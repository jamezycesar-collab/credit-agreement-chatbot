```
User Query → Query Processing → Vector Retrieval → LLM Generation → Formatted Response
                                       ↓
                              Vector Store (FAISS)
                                       ↑
                              Document Processing
                                       ↑
                              Credit Documents Directory

- **LLM (GPT-3.5-turbo)**: ~$30/month
- **LLM (GPT-4)**: ~$450/month
- **Storage**: <$10/month

## Customization Options

### 1. Change LLM Model
```python
chatbot = CreditAgreementChatbot(
    model_name="gpt-4"  # or "gpt-3.5-turbo"
)
```

### 2. Adjust Refresh Interval
```python
chatbot = CreditAgreementChatbot(
    refresh_interval=1800  # 30 minutes
)
```

### 3. Use Different Embedding Model
```python
chatbot = CreditAgreementChatbot(
    embedding_model="sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2"
)
```

### 4. Customize Chunk Sizes
Edit the `text_splitter` configuration in the main class initialization.

## Specialized Capabilities

### Covenant Analysis
- Extract financial and negative covenants
- Identify covenant formulas and calculations
- Track step-downs and exceptions
- Compare requirements vs. actual performance

### Definition Extraction
- Parse complex legal definitions
- Extract financial metric calculations
- Identify cross-referenced terms
- Handle nested and circular definitions

### Compliance Verification
- Cross-reference credit agreements with compliance certificates
- Automatic compliance status determination
- Calculate cushions and margins
- Identify potential breaches

### Pricing Analysis
- Extract pricing grids and fee structures
- Determine applicable pricing levels
- Track margin calculations
- Analyze fee payment schedules

## Best Practices

### For Queries
1. Be specific about what you're looking for
2. Request comparisons explicitly when needed
3. Ask for tables when comparing multiple items
4. Include timeframes and document types when relevant
5. Follow up with clarifying questions as needed

### For Documents
1. Ensure documents are text-searchable
2. Use consistent naming conventions
3. Remove superseded versions
4. Keep pricing grids and tables clearly formatted
5. Maintain complete section numbering

### For Performance
1. Use GPT-3.5-turbo for simple queries
2. Use GPT-4 for complex analysis
3. Adjust retrieval count based on needs
4. Monitor source citations for quality
5. Implement caching for repeated queries

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Poor Retrieval Quality
→ Check document preprocessing with the guide
→ Increase chunk overlap
→ Use better embedding model
→ Add more metadata

### Slow Performance
→ Reduce retrieval count (k parameter)
→ Use smaller embedding model
→ Decrease refresh frequency
→ Implement caching

### Out of Memory
→ Reduce chunk size
→ Process documents in batches
→ Use CPU-based FAISS

### Rate Limits
→ Add exponential backoff
→ Reduce concurrent queries
→ Upgrade OpenAI plan

## Deployment Options

### Local (Current)
- Suitable for: Development, small teams
- Setup time: <30 minutes
- Cost: API usage only

### API Service (FastAPI)
- Suitable for: Medium teams, internal tools
- Setup time: 1-2 hours
- Cost: API + hosting (~$50-200/month)

### Cloud Platform
- Suitable for: Enterprise, external users
- Setup time: 1-3 days
- Cost: API + cloud infrastructure (~$200-1000/month)

## Security Considerations

1. **API Keys**: Never commit to version control
2. **Document Access**: Implement proper authentication
3. **Data Privacy**: Credit documents contain sensitive information
4. **Audit Logging**: Track queries for compliance
5. **Encryption**: Use HTTPS for any API deployment
