## First Queries to Try

Once the chatbot starts, try these queries:

### 1. Find a Covenant
```
What is the maximum leverage ratio covenant requirement?
```

### 2. Look Up a Definition
```
How is EBITDA defined in the credit agreement?
```

### 3. Check Compliance
```
Are we in compliance with all financial covenants?
```

### 4. Compare Documents
```
Compare our total debt in the compliance certificate with the debt limitations in the credit agreement
```

### 5. Get Pricing Information
```
What is the pricing grid and what pricing level applies to us?
```

## Expected Response Format

Every response includes:

1. **Direct Answer** - The information you requested
2. **Source Citations** - Document name, section, and page
3. **Confidence Level** - How certain the system is
4. **Formatted Data** - Tables for comparisons, **highlighted** financial terms

### Example Response:
```
Based on the Senior Credit Agreement dated March 15, 2024, Section 6.12(a),
the Maximum Total Leverage Ratio covenant requires:

- Q1-Q2 2024: ≤ 4.50:1.00
- Q3-Q4 2024: ≤ 4.25:1.00
- Q1 2025 onwards: ≤ 4.00:1.00

Confidence Level: I can confirm this information directly from the credit agreement.

```

## Special Commands

### Refresh Documents
```
refresh
```
Manually triggers document re-indexing (useful after adding new files)

### Exit
```
quit
```
or
```
exit
```

## Configuration Options

### Use GPT-4 (More Accurate)
Edit the chatbot initialization in `credit_agreement_chatbot.py`:
```python
chatbot = CreditAgreementChatbot(
    model_name="gpt-4"  # Change from "gpt-3.5-turbo"
)
```

### Change Refresh Interval
```python
chatbot = CreditAgreementChatbot(
    refresh_interval=1800  # 30 minutes instead of 1 hour
)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "No documents found to index"
**Solution**: Check that your documents are in `credit_documents/` folder and are PDF or DOCX format

### Issue: "OpenAI API key not configured"
**Solution**: 
1. Edit `.env` file
2. Replace `your_openai_api_key_here` with your actual key
3. Restart the chatbot

### Issue: "Missing dependencies"
**Solution**: Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Issue: Slow responses
**Solution**: 
- Use GPT-3.5-turbo instead of GPT-4
- Reduce the number of documents
- Ensure documents are text-searchable (not scanned images)

### Issue: Poor quality answers
**Solution**:
- Switch to GPT-4 for better accuracy
- Ensure documents have clear section numbering
- Check that pricing grids/tables are formatted properly

## Tips for Success

### 🎯 Be Specific
- ❌ "Tell me about the covenants"
- ✓ "What is the maximum leverage ratio covenant and what are the step-downs?"

### 📊 Request Tables
- ❌ "Are we compliant?"
- ✓ "Show me a table comparing all covenant requirements with our actual performance"

### 🔍 Ask Follow-ups
The chatbot remembers context within a session, so follow up:
- First: "What is the pricing grid?"
- Then: "What pricing level do we currently qualify for?"

### 💡 Use Natural Language
The system understands conversational queries:
- "Can we borrow more money?"
- "When is our next payment due?"
- "Are there any upcoming covenant step-downs?"

## Performance Expectations

### Response Time
- Simple queries: 3-5 seconds
- Complex comparisons: 10-15 seconds
- Cross-document analysis: 15-30 seconds

### Accuracy
- With GPT-3.5-turbo: 85-90% for standard queries
- With GPT-4: 95%+ for all query types

### Document Processing
- Initial indexing: 2-5 minutes for 10 documents
- Hourly refresh: 1-3 minutes in background

## Cost Expectations

### Development/Testing (100 queries/day)
- **GPT-3.5-turbo**: ~$6/month
- **GPT-4**: ~$90/month

### Production (500 queries/day)
- **GPT-3.5-turbo**: ~$30/month
